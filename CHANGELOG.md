## 1.0.0 - 2025-11-21

**Stable release**

This version promotes the previously published pre-release (`1.0.0-dev1`) to a stable build. The dependency constraint has been aligned to the latest stable `states_rebuilder: ^6.4.0` so that you can use the package without relying on a dev build of the underlying library.

### Added (from pre-release)
- ✅ **Type-safe updates** for nullable and non-nullable injected states
- ✅ **Boolean helpers** (`toggle()`) for nullable & non-nullable `Injected<bool>`
- ✅ **Multi-injected builders** (`builder`, `builderState`, `builderData`, `builderDataIndexed`)
- ✅ **Tag-based rebuilds** for selective widget notifications
- ✅ **Safe refresh** (`safeRefresh()`) ignoring disposed exceptions
- ✅ **Hot reload mixin** (`RebuildOnHotReloadMixin`) for Flutter Web
- ✅ **Injection helpers** (`InjectExtension`, `MyNull`) for concise creation
- ✅ **API documentation** for public members
- ✅ **Example app & README usage sections**
- ✅ **Initial test suite** covering core behaviors

### Changed
- Dependency: `states_rebuilder` now pinned to stable `^6.4.0`
- README updated to reflect stable release (removed pre-release wording)

### Fixed
- Documentation inconsistencies between example and main README

### Breaking Changes
None – first stable release.
